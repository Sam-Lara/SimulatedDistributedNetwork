# Simulated Distributed Network
This project demonstrates an example of a distributed network via docker containers to simulate nodes communicating with one another using various internet protocols, such as TCP and UDP. The traffic of the network was tracked via wireshark and formatted using pyshark into a log file, logs.text, for easy examination. 

Below is an example of the communication between the master node and the peer nodes.
